# Pizza Bot

Assignment for Technigo-bootcamp. The assignment was to create a site to order pizza, and to use Javascript to handle the order.

## The problem

I made a rough layout before starting just to get a grip on how I wanted it to work, where the order-"button" was and so on. I started by doing a function for each of
the different types of pizzas and then tried to make the code more general. I added a function for the price and number of pizzas to practice on doing functions.
